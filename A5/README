4) Strenghts/Weakness/Features
The program is fairly decoupled from the internal logic. The controller class for the UI only make use of the Store and Order classes. The Store class performs
all of the operations on the data so it was easy to manipulate the data and different UI's.
Right the now the program runs the server with the main UI as to prevent concurrent access to the saved file making it hard to have multiple registers.
The program should perform the required operations on the android, kiosk, and local register side.
