All our system's functionality can be accessed via the Store class which acts as our main point to interactions with the POS. A new or saved Store instance can be loaded into our UI to be run on a kiosk or register. When the Main class is run, if no arguments are provided the instance is defaulted to a Register of id 1, otherwise the user can specify if it is a kiosk instance and the id. ie:

java a4.jar: A new Register with id 1.
java a4.jar true 1: A new Kiosk with id 1.
java a4.jar false 2: A new Register with id 2.

When Main is run, the user will be prompted to login to the Register. After logging in an Employee can interact with the UI menu to Edit Menu Item, Edit Menu, Place Order, or Complete Order.
